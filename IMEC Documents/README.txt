Uploading a file to imec's FTP

	This document contains the instructions for file upload to our FTP server.
	
Design delivery form
	
	This form must be included for each GDS submission.
	The form provides us with all the information we need in order to run DRC verification checks and complete the tape-out forms.
	Please note no checks and no dry run can be made until this form has been submitted.

Tape-out timelines

	The .png files included illustrate the set of actions to complete.
	Please submit your preliminary design 2 weeks before the deadline, at the latest.
	
DRC failure report template (Example) 

	TSMC requires that non-trivial DRC violations that the end-customer wants to waive at his own risk are commented on and described as such. 
	This ppt template demonstrates on how to go about constructing such a form. TSMC will evaluate whether the listed violations are allowed to be waived for tape-out purposes.
	This report should be submitted by the deadline, at the latest (more instructions can be found in the .ppt file).
